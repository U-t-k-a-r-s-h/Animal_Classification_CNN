# Animal_Classification_CNN
A CNN based animal classification system which uses deep neural network to identify features associated with each class and predicts the outcome.
# Technique used
The program is written in Python and uses the google's API tensorflow.
It uses Convolutional Neural Network for detecting the hidden Features of the images and is currently one of the state of the art technique
being used worldwide.
# Optimizer
In this Program i have used the ADAM optimizer as it converges faster due to its momentum based adaptations.
# Loss Funciton
The loss is minimized over Categorical Cross Entropy. Which uses average information to measure the loss.
# The data set can be downloaded from the following link
